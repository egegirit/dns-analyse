1- Pick the next packetloss rate to test (from 10 to 90) and configure it on the server.
2- Run wireshark packet capture on the client.
3- Run the python script (sendDNSRequests.py) to start sending DNS queries.
4- When the script ends, stop packet capture in wireshark and save the captured dns packets to a file.
5- Open the saved file in wireshark again, export the file as JSON (file name: wireshark0PL.json "1PL" stands for 10% packet loss)  
6- Repeat all the steps from 1 to 5 until all the packetloss rates are done.
7- Run the plotter script (createPlots.py) that uses the json files to create a box plot and a bar plot 
   that compares the latencies/failure rates regarding packetloss.

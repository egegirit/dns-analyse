Stale record experiment with ripe atlas:

1.000.000 Daily kredit limit
No one off experiment -> 10 Kredit per query

Assume: Cache count of probes resolver is 18 
Then, about 70 queries for prefetching phase for every probe to fill caches with 95% chance -> 700 Kredits pro probe in prefetching.

Stale phase: 1 query every 1 minute.
Duration of stale phase: 2 hours -> 60 * 2 = 120 queries -> 1200 Kredits per Probe in stale phase

With 500 Probes:
Prefetching -> 350.000 Kredits
2 hours Stale Phase -> 600.000 Kredits
Total -> 950.000 Kredits

Find balance between probe count and stale phase duration

--------------

Create separate A records for each probe with TTL 130 and IP 137.0.0.0
Select 500 Probes

Start packet capture
Start prefetching phase, send 70 queries for each probe
Wait for TTL
Simulate 100 percent packetloss on auth server
Change A record IPs from 137.0.0.0 to 137.1.1.1
Start stale phase, for 2 hours, send a query every minute from all probes.
End packet capture

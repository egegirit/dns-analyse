Stale record experiment with ripe atlas:

1.000.000 Daily kredit limit
No one off experiment -> 10 Kredit per query

Assume: Cache count of probes resolver is 18 
Then, about 70 queries for prefetching phase for every probe to fill caches with 95% chance -> 700 Kredits pro probe in prefetching.

Stale phase: 1 query every 1 minute.
Duration of stale phase: 2 hours -> 60 * 2 = 120 queries -> 1200 Kredits per Probe in stale phase

With 500 Probes:
Prefetching -> 350.000 Kredits
2 hours Stale Phase -> 600.000 Kredits
Total -> 950.000 Kredits

Find balance between probe count and stale phase duration

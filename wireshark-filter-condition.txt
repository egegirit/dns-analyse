Plotting is done after the captured packets are filtered with this condition:
(ip.src == 192.168.1.9 || ip.src == 192.168.1.33) && (ip.dst == 192.168.1.9 || ip.dst == 192.168.1.33)

Note: Filtering the packets captured with DNSPython library doesn't affect the result, no packets filtered.
Filtering the packets captured with Scapy significantly reduces the captured packet count.

Authoritative name server IP Address(Also the client): 139.19.117.11

To get the communication between the server and a resolver:
(ip.src == 139.19.117.11 || ip.src == <resolver-ip>) && (ip.dst == 139.19.117.11 || ip.dst == <resolver-ip>)

To get the client queries to a specific resolver:
(ip.src == 139.19.117.11 || ip.src == <resolver-ip>) && (ip.dst == 139.19.117.11 || ip.dst == <resolver-ip>) && (dns.flags.response == 0)

To get the answers from a specific resolver:
(ip.src == 139.19.117.11 || ip.src == <resolver-ip>) && (ip.dst == 139.19.117.11 || ip.dst == <resolver-ip>) && (dns.flags.response == 1)
